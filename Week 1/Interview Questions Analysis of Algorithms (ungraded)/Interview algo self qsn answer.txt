Question 3 : Egg drop
ANSWER :Version 0: sequential search. Version 1: binary search. Version 2: find an interval containing T of size ≤2T, then do binary search. Version 3: find an interval of size n√, then do sequential search. Note: can be improved to ∼2n−−√ tosses. Version 4: 1+2+3+…+t∼12t2. Aim for c=22√.
