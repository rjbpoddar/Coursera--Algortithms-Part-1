Question 3
Inorder traversal with constant extra space
Answer: -
public void inorder(Node root) {
if (root == null) return;

Node previous;
Node current = root;
while (current != null) {
//current has no left child, print current, then go right
if (current.left == null) {
System.out.println(current.val);
current = current.right;
}
else {
previous = current.left;

//go down to current left children's rightmost child
while (previous.right != null && previous.right != current) {
previous = previous.right;
}

//if the rightmost child hasn't being linked to current, then link it, and traverse to current left
if (previous.right == null) {
previous.right = current;
current = current.left;
}
//if the rightmost child already linked to current (current left children being traversed), then print current and cut the link to restore tree structure
else {
previous.right = null;
System.out.println(current.val);
current = current.right;
}
}
}
}
